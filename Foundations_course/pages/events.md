# Events


**General definition**

Events are schema-less, immutable bytes appended in order and guaranteed to be retrieved in that order. 


**The nuance of events**

Events represent meaningful actions that happened at a specific time and altered the state of a business entity. Events can contain all the relevant information about the action or decision that occurred, allowing future systems or services to understand the circumstances in which the event happened.
